##### About the logo

###### Background

I got this domain thinking about an artistic print-on-demand shop that purchaces art from artists, some of whom have speciall needs. The name "noprecon" is an acronym of "no preconception", and it is meant to imply that buyers shouldn't have any preconceptions about people with speciall needs when they buy these artistic printed goods, and just choose the art for how much they like it. In order to promote such behaviour the idea was to let the buyers know some details about the artist, but not expose if the artist has speciall needs or not. Buyers would know that some of the artists have speciall needs though.

###### Design

The logo is a line-art figure of a woman covering one eye (and leaving the other eye open, which was part of the concept) over a yellow-golden brush stroke.

###### The way I see it

The brush storke represents the art. Yellow represent inclusion, or so I read, and felt it made sense to me. The closed eye represents not seeing the fact that an artist has speciall needs, and also the fact that visitors don't get to know that about artists in the store. The opened eye represents seeing people with speciall needs in general, and not avoiding an individual who may have speciall needs, when it is not only possible but also so easy, as to just browse a store and choose products.
